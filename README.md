# environmental-sound-classification
.This project is basically developed for classifing the environmental sounds.

.In this project i have used different machine learning modules like (Random Forest , SVM, KNN,Gradient Boosting, and CNN).

.Please install all the packages before executing the program.

.The dataset which used for the model training is ESC50
 (Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmoreaux/environmental-sound-classification-50/data)

.I have used models as per my choice you can use different models i you want.

. At the time of Epoch, i got highest accuracy at 25 epoch, try to increase or decrease the number of epoch.
(Note: Increase in epoch number will increase the time to execution of program.)


.Thank you and Happy programming ❤️❤️.
